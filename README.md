**OpenDSP** is an educational platform designed to make **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)** intuitive, interactive, and accessible.

---

##Purpose

OpenDSP aims to demystify the core concepts of DSP through hands-on tools and visualizations. By combining waveform generation, filtering, and spectral analysis in a sleek mobile interface, users can explore how signals behave and transform‚Äîwithout needing expensive lab equipment. Source is open source and forks with improved functionality are encouraged.
